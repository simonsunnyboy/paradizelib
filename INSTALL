Compile ParadizeLib for your target and link the resulting statically linked
library ParadizeLib.a

You need the tool CMAKE (http://www.cmake.org) to compile ParadizeLib. If you 
crosscompile, make sure  to use the appropriate ENABLE_.... CMAKE options and
a suitable toolchain definition.

E.q. for the simple most case:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../

The toolchain definition for the GP2X Wiz is provided under tools/
